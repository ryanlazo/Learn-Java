to create a class: use access modifier (public, protected, default, private) +
class + somename {}

PUBLIC CLASS
is the most open, can be accessed by any class even outside of the
package. if there is nothing before 'class' it is a

DEFAULT CLASS
default is the only accessible in the package that it is in.

PRIVATE/PROTECTED
you cannot start with private or protected and then use another class that is
public. But you can start with a PUBLIC class and then WITHIN that class you can
have a PROTECTED or PRIVATE class.
