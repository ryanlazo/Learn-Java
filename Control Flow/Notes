STANDARD FOR LOOPS

  a standard for loop is a counter used to run through a statement and then
  increment that variable and re-test it.
  1. initialization declaration
  2. test against it your termination statement
  3. do whatever is in your body.
  4. update clause activates.

ENHANCED FOR LOOP (FOR EACH)

  used to iterate through a collection (array, int, boolean etc.)
  boolean[] arr = {true, false, false, true, true};
      boolean someName = arr[3];
  for(boolean i : arr){
    System.out.println(i);

    1. left side: whatever your type and name is (boolean, int, String etc.)
    2. right side: name you are storing the collection in.

WHILE
  given a statement that evaluates to T/F, execute statement if its true otherwise
  the statement is not executed.

DOWHILE
  Do While always executes at least once.
  given a statement that evaluates T/F, execute that statement as long as it
  remains true. Otherwise the statement is not executed.
  - be mindful of the scope of a variable. be aware of your braces {}
  - pre incrementation/decrementation updates the value BEFORE the end of the
  expression.
  - post incrementation/decrementation updates the value AFTER the end of the
  expression () or {}.
